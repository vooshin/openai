message:the philly was incredibly dry and was very small for the price, maybe 10" they also forgot the side of cheese sauce which probably would have helped. for the frings (half fries, half onion rings) im not convinced there were even onions in the onion rings it was all batter and the fries were undercooked and didnt have any salt or anything on them.
