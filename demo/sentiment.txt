    "neutral": 0.2,

    "isNegative": false,
    "isNeutral": false
}

Explanation:
The sentiment analysis of the given text indicates that it is mostly positive with a score of 0.6. It is slightly negative with a score of 0.2 because the order was incorrect. The neutral score is 0.2 because the statement 'but it was still very good' does not express a strong sentiment. The 'isPositive' value is set to true, indicating that the text conveys a mostly positive sentiment, while the 'isNegative' and 'isNeutral' values are set to false.

   "negative":0.25,
   "neutral":0.25,
   "isPositive":true,
   "isNegative":false,
   "isNeutral":false
}

Explanation:
The sentiment of the text is a mixture of positive and negative with some neutral sentiment as well. The positive sentiment comes from "food overall was good" and "it was still very good", while the negative sentiment comes from "order was incorrect". The use of "worth a try" creates a neutral sentiment. The output shows the proportions of each sentiment and also provides a boolean value for each sentiment category.

 ai:Overall, the sentiment of the given text is neutral. The sentiment analysis model has assigned a weight of 0.5 for neutral, 0.2 for negative and 0.3 for positive. Based on these weights, the text is categorized as neither excessively positive nor negative, which affirms that the sentiment is essentially neutral. 

However, as per the requirement, it is necessary to provide additional details about the sentiment. Therefore, the json response also includes Boolean variables to help determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. In this case, the text is not classified as positive or negative, only as neutral with isPositive being false, isNegative being false, and isNeutral being true. 

Hence, the final json response for the given text will be like:

{
  "positive": 0.3,
  "negative": 0.2,
  "neutral": 0.5,
  "isPositive": false,
  "isNegative": false,

 ai:As a language model AI, I do not have a trained sentiment analysis model. However, here is a hypothetical example of how the code may look like:

```
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import json

def sentiment_analysis(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    score = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    positive = score['pos']
    negative = score['neg']
    neutral = score['neu']
    
    response = {
        'positive': positive,
        'negative': negative,
        'neutral': neutral,
        'isPositive': positive > negative and positive > neutral,
        'isNegative': negative > positive and negative > neutral,
        'isNeutral': neutral > positive and neutral > negative
    }
    return json.dumps(response)[:4000]
```

This code uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to perform sentiment analysis using the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer. The code then returns a JSON object that includes the values for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, as well as a boolean value indicating whether the sentiment is predominantly positive, negative or neutral. Finally, the JSON object is limited to less than 4000 characters.

Explanation: Since the input text is "null" or empty, there is no sentiment to be analyzed. Therefore, the sentiment analysis tool returned a neutral sentiment with 100% probability and all other sentiment probabilities are 0. Additionally, all the "is" attributes that indicate whether the sentiment is positive, negative or neutral are set to false since there is no sentiment to be analyzed.

Explanation: The sentiment of the text is mixed as it contains both positive and negative sentiments about different aspects of the experience. The score for each sentiment is 0.333 as there are three sentences in the text. The "isPositive", "isNegative", and "isNeutral" values are all false because the sentiment is not clearly positive, negative, or neutral.
