Extract the feedback text from the input object.\n2. Loop through the `itemNames` array and check if each item name exists in the feedback text.\n3. If an item name is found in the feedback text, add it to the `item_names` array and find its corresponding item ID from the `itemAndIdMap` array and add it to the `item_ids` array.\n4. Create a new object with `item_names`, `review`, and `delivery_uuid` properties and assign their respective values.\n5. Return the new object as output.\n\nNote: You may need to handle cases where an item name is mentioned multiple times in the feedback text or there are multiple items in the order.",
