Explanation:
- The message is negative and mentions that the customer upgraded to onion rings but still received fries, indicating a "Quantity Issue" with their order. Therefore, "Quantity Issue" has the highest matching percentage of 80%.
- There is also a "Taste Issue" mentioned with a matching percentage of 60%, which is lower than the "Quantity Issue" matching percentage but still significant.
- Other issues mentioned with varying lower matching percentages include "Quality Issue", "Packaging Issue", "Price Issue", "Cooking Issue", "Freshness Issue", "Staleness Issue", "Hardness Issue", and "Oiliness Issue". 
- No matching percentages were assigned to the remaining labels as they were not mentioned in the message. 

Note: The matching percentages assigned to each label are subjective and may vary based on individual interpretation.

Explanation:
The message indicates that only a part of the order was delivered, which suggests a Quantity Issue. The fact that the customer tried to call in for a refund and received no response suggests a Delivery & Timing Issue. It is also possible that there is a Missing Food Issue since only a part of the order arrived. All other issues, including Quality, Taste, Packaging, Price, Cooking, Freshness, Staleness, Hardness, Spice, Temperature, Wrong Food, Hygiene, Oiliness, Out of Stock, and Foreign Object Issues do not seem to apply to the situation.

Explanation:

The message indicates dissatisfaction with the appearance and taste of the food, so we assign a high score to "Quality Issue" (90) and a moderate score to "Taste Issue" (60).

There are no indications of issues related to quantity, packaging, delivery, price, cooking, freshness, spice, temperature, wrong food, hygiene, missing food, oiliness, out of stock, or foreign objects, so those labels are assigned scores of 0.

The message does imply that the food is not fresh and may be stale, hence the "Staleness Issue" is assigned a score of 80. 

The results are returned in a JSON object with the label names as keys and the corresponding scores as values. The scores are percentages and reflect the estimated likelihood that the message pertains to each issue type.
